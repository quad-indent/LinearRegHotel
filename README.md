# Hotel Prophet

Originally started developing it to predict guest ratings at a hotel, decided to add modularity to it to expand the scope of what data it can deal with.

Currently it includes the main module that uses a neural network, and two modules that allow for manipulation of training data and another that allows the user to specify parameters for prediction based upon the former.
Both come with a simple GUI.
## Features

- Customisable labels for datasets
- GUI that offers control over user input for datasets
- Rudimentary linear regression model to analyse the data


## Contributing

Contributions more than welcome!

This is one of my first projects in Python and my first GitHub repository, so I would greatly appreciate any help I can get
